sys — gives access to system-specific features, such as command-line arguments and cleanly exiting the program.
PyQt5 — the main GUI toolkit we’re using.
QtWidgets handles windows, buttons, menus, etc.
QtWebEngineWidgets lets us embed a web engine (Chromium) that can render PDFs, HTML, etc.


We define a class called PDFViewer, inheriting from QMainWindow (a standard top-level application window in Qt).

__init__ is the constructor — runs when you create a PDFViewer() object.
super().__init__() calls the parent constructor to set up the window correctly.

self.viewer = QtWebEngineWidgets.QWebEngineView()
self.setCentralWidget(self.viewer)
Creates a web view widget — this is a mini browser that can render a PDF directly.
Makes this viewer the central widget of the main window (so it fills the window).

QFileDialog.getOpenFileName() — opens a standard file picker dialog.
The first argument (self) makes it modal to the main window.
"Open PDF" — title of the dialog.
"" — starting folder (empty means “current”)
"PDF Files (*.pdf)" — only show .pdf files.
It returns a tuple — (file_path, file_type_filter). We only need file_path.
If the user picked a file, self.viewer.load(QtCore.QUrl.fromLocalFile(file_path)) loads that local PDF file into the embedded browser view.

if __name__ == "__main__": → ensures this only runs if the script is executed directly, not imported.
QtCore is imported here to access QUrl.
QApplication initializes the Qt environment. It’s required before creating any GUI elements.
viewer = PDFViewer() creates your main window.
viewer.show() makes it visible.
app.exec_() starts the Qt event loop — this keeps your window alive until it’s closed.
sys.exit() normally closes the app cleanly with an exit code, but in Spyder or Jupyter, it prints “SystemExit: 0”.
So we wrap it in try/except to suppress that harmless warning.


For app
First, find where you saved your script (pdf_viewer.py).
cd "C:\Users\ACER\Documents\Projects\PDFViewer"
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed pdf_viewer.py
